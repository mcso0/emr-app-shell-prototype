# Plan/Order Work Lifecycle And RPC Boundary

## Goal

Implement one authoritative requested/in-progress/paused/completed/returned/
cancelled attempt lifecycle with separate assignee metadata, detailed phase,
history, and DB-level capability enforcement.

## Scope

- Add task assignee, assigned actor/time, started actor/time, detailed phase,
  prior paused phase, and revision/idempotency fields with immutable events.
- Add assign/claim/start/phase/pause/resume/return/handoff mutations and active
  assignee eligibility checks using existing route capabilities.
- Retire `accepted` from new writes. Migrate historical `accepted` with start
  evidence to `in_progress` and without evidence to `requested`, preserving a
  legacy event. Never infer from display names.
- Preserve returned attempts and create linked re-request attempts without
  duplicate active work.
- Extend execution and queue read models with safe assignee DTOs and phase.
- Preserve operating date/encounter context when navigating to downstream work.
- Add `chart:view`/`billing:view` checks to identified read RPCs and close direct
  legacy confirm/bill access through `clair_save_chart_order_action`.

## Out Of Scope

- Clinical master value authoring.
- Row-level billing adjustments and tax arithmetic.
- Final fixed 25-column chart rendering.

## Done When

- Assignment never changes common work state; start and handoff are distinct,
  auditable operations.
- Every target transition has allow/deny, stale revision, replay, cross-workspace,
  and wrong-permission coverage.
- Returned is a first-class terminal attempt and cannot be overwritten by a new
  request cycle.
- Direct RPC callers cannot bypass chart/billing capability or atomic
  confirmation.
- Lab, imaging, dispensing, and treatment screens expose the authorized target
  actions without placeholder user IDs.

## Verification

- SQL transaction tests and migration replay/rollback.
- Fulfillment server/API/UI tests for all target transitions and denial cases.
- TypeScript, focused lint, docs check, secret scan, and diff check.
- Remote read-only preflight and transaction rollback rehearsal before an exact
  persistent migration packet.

## Handoff Notes

Remote inspection found no current `accepted` or `returned` queue rows, but the
schema and RPC still permit both. Preserve the four historical
`ready_for_billing`/draft compatibility rows untouched unless a separately
reviewed deterministic migration covers them.
